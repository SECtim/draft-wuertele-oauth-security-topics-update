1.  Introduction

   Since the publication of the first OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practices
   document [@!RFC9700], new threats to OAuth 2.0 ecosystems have been
   identified.  This document therefore serves as an extension of the
   original [@!RFC9700] and is to be read in conjunction with it.

   Like [@!RFC9700] before, this document provides important security
   recommendations and it is RECOMMENDED that implementers upgrade their
   implementations and ecosystems as soon as feasible.

1.1.  Structure

   TODO explain the document structure and how it "fits" with
   [@!RFC9700]

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization
   endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization server", "client",
   "client identifier" (client ID), "protected resource", "refresh
   token", "resource owner", "resource server", and "token endpoint"
   defined by OAuth 2.0 [@!RFC6749].
