                OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice
           draft-wuertele-oauth-security-topics-update-latest

Abstract

   This document updates the set of best current security practices for
   OAuth 2.0 by extending the security advice given in RFC 6749, RFC
   6750, and RFC 9700, to cover new threats that have been discovered
   since the former documents have been published.

1.  Introduction

   Since the publication of the first OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practices
   document [RFC9700], new threats to OAuth 2.0 ecosystems have been
   identified.  This document therefore serves as an extension of the
   original [RFC9700] and is to be read in conjunction with it.

   Like [RFC9700] before, this document provides important security
   recommendations and it is RECOMMENDED that implementers upgrade their
   implementations and ecosystems as soon as feasible.

1.1.  Structure

   TODO explain the document structure and how it "fits" with [RFC9700]

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization
   endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization server", "client",
   "client identifier" (client ID), "protected resource", "refresh
   token", "resource owner", "resource server", and "token endpoint"
   defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

3.  Attacks and Mitigations

   TODO section intro, mention that we do not repeat [RFC9700] stuff
   here

3.1.  Audience Injection Attacks

   When using signature-based client authentication methods such as
   private_key_jwt as defined in [OpenID.Core] or signed JWTs as defined
   in [RFC7521] and [RFC7523], a malicious authorization server may be
   able to obtain and use a client's authentication credential, enabling
   them to impersonate a client towards another honest authorization
   server.

3.1.1.  Attack Description

   The descriptions here follow [TODO paper], where additional details
   of the attack are laid out.  Audience injection attacks require a
   client to interact with at least two authorization servers, one of
   which is malicious, and to authenticate to both with a signature-
   based authentication method using the same key pair.  Furthermore,
   the client needs to be willing to authenticate at an endpoint other
   than the token endpoint at the attacker authorization server.  The
   following description uses the pushed authorization request endpoint
   defined by [RFC9126], see below for further variants.


   // Mention OID Federation and FAPI 2.0 here as examples of profiles
   // that force clients to do that?
   //
   // -- Tim W.

   Assume that the authorization servers publish the following URIs for
   their authorization, token, and pushed authorization request
   endpoints, for example via mechanisms such as authorization server
   metadata [RFC8414] or OpenID Discovery [OpenID.Discovery].  However,
   audience injection attacks are also possible on clients with manually
   configured authorization server metadata.

   Excerpt from H-AS' metadata:

   "issuer": "https://honest.com",
   "authorization_endpoint": "https://honest.com/authorize",
   "token_endpoint": "https://honest.com/token",
   "pushed_authorization_request_endpoint": "https://honest.com/par",
   ...

   Excerpt from A-AS' metadata:

   "issuer": "https://attacker.com",
   "authorization_endpoint": "https://attacker.com/authorize",
   "token_endpoint": "https://honest.com/token",
   "pushed_authorization_request_endpoint": "https://attacker.com/par",
   ...

   I.e., the attacker authorization server claims to use the honest
   authorization server's token endpoint.  The attack now commences as
   follows:

   1.  Client registers at H-AS, and gets assigned a client ID cid.

   2.  Client registers at A-AS, and gets assigned the same client ID
       cid.  Note that the client ID is not a secret and often send
       through the front channel.

   3.  Client starts an authorization code grant, e.g., triggered by the
       attacker as a user of the client, with A-AS by sending a pushed
       authorization request to A-AS' pushed authorization request
       endpoint.

   One of the parameters of that pushed authorization request is a
   client_assertion that authenticates the client.

   TODO show and explain the contents of the client assertion

   TODO explain how the attacker can now use the assertion to break
   authZ
