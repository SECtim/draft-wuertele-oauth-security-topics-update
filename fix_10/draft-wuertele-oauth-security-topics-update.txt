1.  Introduction

   Since the publication of the first OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practices
   document [RFC9700], new threats to OAuth 2.0 ecosystems have been
   identified.  This document therefore serves as an extension of the
   original [RFC9700] and is to be read in conjunction with it.

   Like [RFC9700] before, this document provides important security
   recommendations and it is RECOMMENDED that implementers upgrade their
   implementations and ecosystems as soon as feasible.

1.1.  Structure

   TODO explain the document structure and how it "fits" with [RFC9700]

1.2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization
   endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization server", "client",
   "client identifier" (client ID), "protected resource", "refresh
   token", "resource owner", "resource server", and "token endpoint"
   defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

2.  Attacks and Mitigations

   TODO section intro, mention that we do not repeat [RFC9700] stuff
   here

2.1.  Audience Injection Attacks

   When using signature-based client authentication methods such as
   private_key_jwt as defined in [OpenID.Core] or signed JWTs as defined
   in [RFC7521] and [RFC7523], a malicious authorization server may be
   able to obtain and use a client's authentication credential, enabling
   them to impersonate a client towards another honest authorization
   server.

2.1.1.  Attack Description

   The descriptions here follow [research.ust], where additional details
   of the attack are laid out.  Audience injection attacks require a
   client to interact with at least two authorization servers, one of
   which is malicious, and to authenticate to both with a signature-
   based authentication method using the same key pair.  The following
   description uses the jwt-bearer client authentication from [RFC7523],
   see Section 2.1.1.3 for other affected client authentication methods.
   Furthermore, the client needs to be willing to authenticate at an
   endpoint other than the token endpoint at the attacker authorization
   server (see Section 2.1.1.2).

2.1.1.1.  Core Attack Steps

   In the following, let H-AS be an honest authorization server and let
   A-AS be an attacker-controlled authorization server.

   Assume that the authorization servers publish the following URIs for
   their token endpoints, for example via mechanisms such as
   authorization server metadata [RFC8414] or OpenID Discovery
   [OpenID.Discovery].  The exact publication mechanism is not relevant,
   as audience injection attacks are also possible on clients with
   manually configured authorization server metadata.

   Excerpt from H-AS' metadata:

   "issuer": "https://honest.com",
   "token_endpoint": "https://honest.com/token",
   ...

   Excerpt from A-AS' metadata:

   "issuer": "https://attacker.com",
   "token_endpoint": "https://honest.com/token",
   ...

   Therefore, the attacker authorization server claims to use the honest
   authorization server's token endpoint.  Note that the attacker
   authorization server does not control this endpoint.  The attack then
   commences as follows:

   1.  Client registers at H-AS, and gets assigned a client ID cid.

   2.  Client registers at A-AS, and gets assigned the same client ID
       cid.  Note that the client ID is not a secret (Section 2.2 of
       [RFC6749]).

   Now, whenever the client creates a client assertion for
   authentication to A-AS, the assertion consists of a JSON Web Token
   (JWT) that is signed by the client and contains, among others, the
   following claims:

   "iss": "cid",
   "sub": "cid",
   "aud": "https://honest.com/token"

   Due to the malicious use of H-AS' token endpoint in A-AS'
   authorization server metadata, the aud claim contains H-AS' token
   endpoint.  Recall that both A-AS and H-AS registered the client with
   client ID cid, and that the client uses the same key pair for
   authentication at both authorization servers.  Hence, this client
   assertion is a valid authentication credential for the client at
   H-AS.

   As described in [research.ust], the attacker can then utilize the
   obtained client authentication assertion to impersonate the client
   and, for example, obtain access tokens.

2.1.1.2.  Endpoints Requiring Client Authentication

   As mentioned above, the attack is only possible if the client
   authenticates to an endpoint other than the token endpoint at A-AS.
   This is because if the client sends a token request to A-AS, it will
   use A-AS' token endpoint as published by A-AS and hence, send the
   token request to H-AS, i.e., the attacker cannot obtain the client
   assertion.

   As detailed in [research.ust], the attack is confirmed to be possible
   if the client authenticates with such client assertions at the
   following endpoints of A-AS:

   *  Pushed Authorization Endpoint (see [RFC9126])

   *  Token Revocation Endpoint (see [RFC7009])

   *  CIBA Backchannel Authentication Endpoint (see [OpenID.CIBA])

   *  Device Authorization Endpoint (see [RFC8628])

   Note that this list of examples is not exhaustive.  Hence, any client
   that might authenticate at any endpoint other than the token endpoint
   SHOULD employ countermeasures as described in Section 2.1.2.

2.1.1.3.  Affected Client Authentication Methods

   The same attacks are possible for the private_key_jwt client
   authentication method defined in [OpenID.Core], as well as
   instantiations of client authentication assertions defined in
   [RFC7521], including the SAML assertions defined in [RFC7522].

   Furthermore, a similar attack is possible for jwt-bearer
   authorization grants as defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC7523], albeit
   under additional assumptions (see [research.ust] for details).

2.1.2.  Countermeasures

   At its core, audience injection attacks exploit the fact that, from
   the client's point of view, an authorization server's token endpoint
   is a mostly opaque value and does not uniquely identify an
   authorization server.  Therefore, an attacker authorization server
   may claim any URI as its token endpoint, including, for example, an
   honest authorization server's issuer identifier.  Hence, as long as a
   client uses the token endpoint as an audience value when
   authenticating to the attacker authorization server, audience
   injection attacks are possible.  Therefore, audience injection
   attacks need to be prevented by the client.

   Note that the following countermeasures mandate the use of single
   audience value (as opposed to multiple audiences in array).  This is
   because Section 4.1.3 of [RFC7519] allows the receiver of an
   audience-restricted JWT to accept the JWT even if the receiver
   identifies with only one of the values in such an array.

   Clients that interact with more than one authorization server and
   authenticate with signature-based client authentication methods MUST
   employ one of the following countermeasures, unless audience
   injection attacks are mitigated by other means, such as using fresh
   key material for each authorization server.

2.1.2.1.  Authorization Server Issuer Identifier

   Clients MUST use the authorization server's issuer identifier as
   defined in [RFC8414]/[OpenID.Discovery] as the sole audience value in
   client assertions.  Clients MUST retrieve and validate this value as
   described in Section 3.3 of [RFC8414]/Section 4.3 of
   [OpenID.Discovery].

   For jwt-bearer client assertions as defined by [RFC7523], this
   mechanism is also described in [OAUTH-7523bis].

   Note that "issuer identifier" here does not refer to the term
   "issuer" as defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC9700], but to the issuer
   identifier defined in [RFC8414] and [OpenID.Discovery].  In
   particular, the issuer identifier is not just "an abstract identifier
   for the combination the authorization endpoint and token endpoint".

2.1.2.2.  Exact Target Endpoint URI

   Clients MUST use the exact endpoint URI to which a client assertion
   is sent as that client assertion's sole audience value.

   This countermeasure can be used for authorization servers that do not
   use authorization server metadata [RFC8414] or OpenID Discovery
   [OpenID.Discovery].
