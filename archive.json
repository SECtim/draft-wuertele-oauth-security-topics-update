Not necessarily a reason to not include this proposal, but something to be aware of.\n\n> But if its single aud, then i gotta create cla twice, one per endpoint.\n\nOnly when using the \"exact endpoint\" audience defense, i.e., when no issuer identifier is available.\n\n> This can discourage people to cleanup/call revoke given the performance penalty (jti was introduced there for performance/replay reason).\n\nI wouldn't say that `jti` was introduced to enable replay - actually, quite the opposite: To (at least optionally) prevent replay. For example, the default for [OpenID Connect authentication JWTs](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication) is \"These tokens MUST only be used once\". In the IETF world, the usual formulation is something like \"MAY use `jti` to ensure that JWTs are not replayed\", e.g., in [RFC7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7), [RFC7521](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7521#section-5.1), [RFC7522](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7522#section-3), [RFC7523](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7523#section-3), and [RFC9449](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449#name-dpop-proof-jwt-syntax).\n\n> let's say we want to allow multiple aud from the same issuer. or more generally, as is today, when people put multiple aud, what's one-time use of jti mean? is that one-time use per aud, or across all audiences. should we clarify?\n\nThat's a can of worms this document certainly should not open, because it has nothing to do with audience injection attacks or their mitigation.\nThat said, in my opinion, the original formulations around `jti` and JWT replay/reuse are somewhat unfortunate, because they end up saying \"do whatever you want\" (with the exception of OIDC, but that also leaves the door open to \"unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties\"), instead of giving clear options with their respective pros and cons.\n\n---\n\nSo, to summarize what I think:\n- This document should definitely avoid talking about `jti` and JWT replay/reuse.\n- I am in principle open to discuss the possibility of allowing `aud` arrays, but at least for RFCs 7521, 7522, 7523, and 9126, as well as the OIDF specs OIDC, CIBA, FAPI 1.0, and FAPI 2.0, corresponding updates/drafts thereof do require single-valued audiences; so talking about multi-valued `aud`s here might confuse people.",

Performance-critical applications may not want to use `jti`, where security-critical applications use `jti` to prevent replay.\n\nThere were (at least) two specs regarding `jti`\n- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7 says `jti` is optional, whereas\n- https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication says `jti` is required \n\nI missed the 2nd spec initially, and thought that most people aren't using `jti` since it's optional (given that replay is, to certain degree, mitigated by `exp` already). So I raised the concerns. \n\nSince `jti` is already a required thing in the context of using jwt as client authentication, then I assume people is likely re-generating a new cla fresh anyway whenever it hits an endpoint.

Consider a client that always includes the token and revocation endpoints in its client assertions (which is perfectly fine w.r.t. the relevant standards). In that case, the attacker AS can publish the following metadata (excerpt):\n```\ntoken_endpoint: att.com/token,\nrevocation_endpoint: hon.com/token\n```\nThe client's token request (to what the client thinks is the attacker AS) goes to `att.com/token` (i.e., to the attacker) and includes a client assertion with `aud: [\"att.com/token\", \"hon.com/token\"]`. That `aud` value is also valid for requests to `hon.com/token` (and maybe other endpoints of `hon.com` as well, see #8). Hence, this is an instance of an audience injection attack.\n\nWithout AS changes, most combinations of endpoints with client authentication can be (ab)used in one way or the other by an attacker to obtain a client assertion that's valid somewhere else _unless_ the client chooses an `aud` value that's either the issuer identifier or the exact target endpoint. Hence, I'd be very careful in trying to come up with some \"clever\" way for the client to ensure its AS registrations are \"not attackable\" (and, what's more: Any such requirement on the client would be in conflict with the current and widely implemented logic of \"client ID and AS endpoints are provided by the AS and (mostly) opaque values to the client\" with only very minimal restrictions, such as mandatory HTTPS for the token endpoint).\n\nAlso note that just doing another round of DCR - even if feasible, think of stuff like initial access tokens that are typically one-time use - is not at all guaranteed to result in a different client ID. In some cases, having the same client ID for all registrations of a given client (even across ASs) is mandatory, e.g., in OpenID Federation.\n\nI.e., I think this mechanism might introduce problems in practice and, more importantly, doesn't reliably work as a defense.",

Multiple values in aud is asking for trouble.\n\nI see here you're implicitly expecting client to use a **single** aud value for your solution to be secured too.

If we want to generalize, it could be said as \"there\u2019re no overlaps of client_id and token_endpoint (or whatever values client use in the aud) pairs for all its ASes\".

But apparently, you seem to expect all ASes to readily take any values that identify themselves (could be issuer, token_EP, par_EP, etc, and so no AS change is needed).\n\nMy take on this is twofold: First, the \"expectation\" that an AS will accept the exact target endpoint and its issuer identifier as `aud` is a normative requirement in all specs (that I am aware of) outside of the \"original culprits (OIDC, RFCs 752x)\" that do say something about the `aud` values an AS has to accept (RFC 9126 and CIBA) contain a sentence like: _\"the authorization server MUST accept its issuer identifier, token endpoint URL, or pushed authorization request endpoint URL as values that identify it as an intended audience.\"_ (quote is from the Pushed AuthZ Request RFC)\n\nSecond, in any case, I think we do agree that the current normative language around what `aud` values an AS is allowed to accept does not conflict with the proposed fixes, i.e., they do not require normative changes to the AS.\n\n> So in this imperfect world, what can a client do to secure itself while still keeping the lights on when these \"standard-non-compliant\" servers will only accept \"aud=token_EP\"?\n\nIf you as a client are willing to continue using an AS that\n1. Requires authentication at more than the token endpoint;\n2. Expects its token endpoint as the sole `aud` value at ALL these endpoints (keep in mind, for at least CIBA and PAR, an AS is _explicitly_ required to accept the respective exact endpoint as `aud`);\n3. Does not care enough about its clients' security to change what `aud` values it accepts; and \n4. Does not offer a way for you as a client to update your registered key material\n   1. Note 1: the current text explicitly mentions the possibility of using different key material for each AS as an alternative defense\n   2. Note 2: it is sufficient if the AS just allows the client to rotate their authentication public key, i.e., the AS does not need to support full-blown Dynamic Client Management or similar (and while not _required_ in any spec that I know of - albeit some specs like RFC 7591, OIDC, and OIDC DCR do explicitly mention key rotation, FAPI 2.0 SP \"recommends\" it - I think we can agree that not allowing key rotation is a red flag in the first place)\n\n... then yes, the currently proposed fixes cannot be applied to all communication with that particular AS.\nThat said, I'd argue that this is such a special case that it does not justify including a defense...\n- That will only work in this very particular special case (assuming that some other things are clarified, e.g., the handling of `mtls_endpoint_aliases`),\n- Relies on the AS continuing to only accept its token endpoint,\n- Should certainly NOT be used when any other defense is available,\n- Relies on the client not doing \"strange, but technically allowed\" things when talking to the attacker AS (like using the attacker AS' PAR endpoint as an `aud` value for requests to other endpoints of the attacker AS; note that it is the attacker who \"defines\" what it wants from the client, so if the client wants to talk to the attacker AS, it has to comply), and\n- Breaks currently allowed setups where multiple perfectly honest, standards-compliant ASs may share a token endpoint (probably not a _common_ case, but allowed nonetheless).\n\n... in a BCP update. Including a \"quick and dirty\" works-in-some-scenarios-but-not-in-others defense has huge potential for confusion - and I'd expect to then see clients implement this less-than-ideal defense, but never re-evaluating whether an actual fix can be deployed at a later time.\n\n> But of course, this discussion is meaningful only if you're convinced about the backward compatibility issue.\n\nAs of right now, I am not really convinced that backward compatibility will be a huge issue (see the enumeration of preconditions above). That said, I still see value in discussing, because I may of course overlook things.\n\n---\n\n> I see here you're implicitly expecting client to use a single aud value for your solution to be secured too.\n\nThat is not an implicit expectation, the current text very much explicitly says \"sole audience value\".\n\n> If a client uses the same client_id across all ASes and include all issuers in its aud=[issuer1, issuer2], then it can be screwed too.\n\nIf a client issues an assertion that is _intended_ (which is what `aud` expresses) to be valid at multiple ASs, then it shouldn't come as a surprise that this assertion _will_ be valid at (those exact!) multiple ASs - hence, I would not consider that an attack.\nThat said, _intending_ an authentication credential for multiple ASs (that the client generally has to assume will be issuing different client_ids) is a very strange choice by the client, albeit technically allowed (but will be forbidden by the proposed fixes, not only in this document, but also the proposed updates to RFCs 752x, OIDC, CIBA, ..., which I think is a good thing).\n\n> the alternative fix is meant for a vulnerable client that uses a single aud = token_EP.\n\nI am not sure what you're trying to say here - that the alternative fix is only meant for clients that use single-valued `aud`? For which AS(s)? Or something entirely different?",

          "body": "Let's not go line by line about my previous response. With due respect, I disagree your counterexample serves to invalidate a quick-and-dirty fix, which is meant to be a quick and dirty fix.\n\n---\n\nMore importantly, as a reader from the engineering world, if I read OIDC (specifically [section 9](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication) and may be also RFC752x), and implemented everything there with AS accepting **only** token EP (note that there're no such Updates/Deprecates header on OIDC docs), I'll be happily declaring that I'm fully standard-compliant. It's unlikely I'd go look at CIBA and RFC9126 (PAR) until there's a need to support those extensions.\n\nAnd if we read the whole passages from CIBA and RFC9126(PAR) in their entirety, they both recognized there's ambiguity on `aud` value, and thus backward compatibility issues. People can always say I gotta balance resources/risk among priorities other than just security. Putting myself into the shoes of the opposing side, some will likely argue that they're NOT a normative change anyone has to follow or have followed, since (1) they have no Updates/Deprecates header for the older RFC/OIDC; (2) they can be interpreted as extension-specific; (3) the last \"MUST\" sentence that you quoted is also a conditional statement applicable to those who need/want to facilitate interoperability; and/or (4) the last sentence from CIBA and RFC9126 sound kinda incompatible with each other if I need to support both CIBA and RFC9126. It doesn't mean/matter if I, as a security folk, fully agree, that's just how the world works. You will understand as you enter the industry. :)\n\nFrom [CIBA](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#auth_request)\n\n> Note that there's some potential ambiguity around the appropriate audience value to use when JWT client assertion based authentication is employed. To address that ambiguity the Issuer Identifier of the OP SHOULD be used as the value of the audience. To facilitate interoperability, the OP MUST accept its Issuer Identifier, Token Endpoint URL, or Backchannel Authentication Endpoint URL as values that identify it as an intended audience.\n\nFrom [RFC9126](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126#section-2-5)\n\n> Due to historical reasons, there is potential ambiguity regarding the appropriate audience value to use when employing JWT client assertion-based authentication (defined in [Section 2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523#section-2.2) of [[RFC7523](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7523)] with private_key_jwt or client_secret_jwt authentication method names per Section 9 of [[OIDC](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)]). To address that ambiguity, the issuer identifier URL of the authorization server according to [[RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414)] SHOULD be used as the value of the audience. In order to facilitate interoperability, the authorization server MUST accept its issuer identifier, token endpoint URL, or pushed authorization request endpoint URL as values that identify it as an intended audience.\n\nMy two cents. May be I'm wrong, BCP is BCP, technically it's not a standard. No matter what will be written, people might have different opinions on considering anything there as normative changes or not. Regardless, your contribution on writing up a useful BCP is valuable, if possible, take the chance to cleanup the mess. Give a comprehensive guide on how things can be best fixed, and leave no/less ambiguity so people can have excuses. And that's my perhaps naive belief. :)\n\nAnd so, just as a random reader (who'd appreciate a well-documented reference to use against Goliath :)), I'd love to see:\n- at least recognize the ambiguity like CIBA/RFC9126, so people know a client change from token_EP to something else may be a breaking change, since it does not guarantee server acceptance. If it just works, cool!\n- the BCP / most recommended `aud` value a client should send. conforming to CIBA and RFC9126, apparently should be the issuer.\n- the BCP for AS, what `aud` value should it accept? regardless of whether it's interpreted as normative or just a BCP recommendation. You probably want AS to accept only either issuer or target-specific endpoint URL. I'd argue making it target endpoint specific is never clearly spelled out by any other spec. For instance, PAR endpoint should not take aud=token_EP, and token_endpoint should not take aud=par_EP, unless for interoperability/historical reasons.\n- the BCP if just in case a client cannot get all your ASes to comply, then there comes recommendations in decreasing preference. 1. use different (the current draft uses the word \"fresh\") key material per AS; 2. ensure no overlapping of (client_id, aud) among all supported current and future ASes (unless absolutely required... it's okay to condition that), etc...\n\nThey're my little suggestions for you to consider and decide one way or the other. Thanks and appreciate that. :)",

My point is less is better when drafting up the spec.\n\n**Clarify the scope of \"Open Ecosystems\":**\n\n> I have to also admit that I have a different opinion on DCR. May be I should not accuse it with \u201cno body using it\u201d or \u201cimpractical\u201d, when I lately figured the open-banking standard backed by UK gov has DCR standardized (99% similar to OAuth2 DCR as I briefly overviewed). Think about there\u2019s a universal banking app that works across all different (UK) banks. I assume a user can just go to such a universal banking app, choose let\u2019s say HSBC (which under the hood hits HSBC\u2019s DCR) or even directly specify any URL that conforms to the UK open-banking standard. Then the client negotiates some client credential for oauth client authentication, and subsequently launches auth code grant to authenticate the user too. \n> \n> I don\u2019t know whether we should classify it as open-ecosystem, where the app will then speak the same standardized banking protocols regardless of what bank resource servers are. May be they can support bank/issuer-sharing oauth scenarios since even a single user can have multiple bank accounts with a single bank. But it does have certain openness where a user can dynamically feed a new OAuth \u201cclient-configuration\u201d at will, and can face COAT attacks. \n> \n> I don\u2019t know how widely adopted that thing is, may be there\u2019s just some part of the world in EU we don\u2019t know enough.

Let me clarify:\n\n**On AS-sharing:**\n* If a client can guarantee uniqueness of AS, as you said, RFC9700 4.4 suffices, which is true.\n* If a client cannot guarantee uniqueness of AS, my claim is, RFC9700 4.4 still suffices (though there is an alternative) in defense (4.4.2), but needs clarifications on the attack descriptions (4.4.1). \n\n----\nFor **attack descriptions** (4.4.1), there are some ambiguities in the texts:\n> Preconditions: For this variant of the attack to work, it is assumed that\n> ...\n> * **the client stores the authorization server chosen by the user** in a session bound to the user's browser and uses the same redirection URI for each authorization server.\n\n> Attack on the authorization code grant:\n> ...\n> 2. **The client stores in the user's session that the user selected \"A-AS\"** and ...\n\nImplementers may argue that, \"storing the _authorization server_ chosen by the user\" will break the functional requirement of tracking issuer-sharing client configurations (e.g., sending the correct client credentials to the token endpoint). In other words, for a client to distinguish issuer-sharing client configurations, it cannot (just) store the \"authorization server\" chosen by the user, but should (also) store the \"client configuration\". Thus, the attacks in scenarios with shared issuers are simply out of scope of RFC9700 4.4.1, since the preconditions do not hold.\n\nThis is the confusing part with the attack description. I tried to clarify it in https://kevinluo2000.github.io/TestIETF/draft-wuertele-oauth-security-topics-update.html#name-attack-description-2.\n\n\n----\nWhen it comes to **countermeasures** (4.4.2), however, I would argue that 4.4 is sufficient.\nThe defenses in 4.4.2 requires the client to track each issuer (in a session), and compare with the returned issuer. The defenses do work for issuer-sharing client configurations, because the issuer bind authorization and token endpoints, leaving no room for the infiltration of a malicious endpoint. A client supporting issuer-sharing client configurations can, store the client configuration chosen by the user (for functional needs), and, at the same time, store and compare the returned issuer (for mix-up defense).\n\nTherefore, I suggested the \"distinct redirect_uri per client configuration\" defense as an _alternative_ to issuer-based defenses. See https://kevinluo2000.github.io/TestIETF/draft-wuertele-oauth-security-topics-update.html#name-countermeasures-2.\n",

For some endpoints like PAR and CIBA, that's also explicitly required by the respective specs (see the discussion in #13). I.e., there are no _normative_ changes to the AS, which is what the current text says.\r\n\r\nThat said (and taking into consideration the engineer perspective): What is your proposal? Should the text explicitly say that even though there as no normative changes, a concrete AS implementation may need to be adapted? Or are you suggesting to make normative changes, i.e., _requiring_ as AS to (only?) accept its issuer identifier and/or the exact endpoint as `aud`, even though that's not strictly necessary to prevent the attack?\r\n\r\n> It's always better to define a clear (and standardized) contract between clients and servers. A client then needs to not to maintain a map like serverA can only take token_endpoint, while server B&C accept only issuer\r\n\r\nThe current text actually does this (albeit not in a normative way) - it basically says: If you as a client use Discovery/AS Metadata with that AS, then use the issuer identifier; otherwise, use the exact endpoint URI (as the sole `aud` value in both cases). The AS can safely accept both (or, for example, require its clients to always use AS Metadata, and hence, the issuer identifier, as is the case, e.g., for FAPI 2.0 SP).\r\n\r\nDo you propose to make this distinction (AS Metadata/Discovery => Issuer Identifier; otherwise => exact endpoint) an explicit normative requirement?\r\nWe tried to avoid that to leave ecosystems the option to, e.g., always use the issuer identifier, even if they don't use AS Metadata/Discovery (in which case the client needs to validate the \"issuer identifier to endpoints\" mapping out of band, but getting AS information out of band, e.g., by configuration, is a common practice anyway; and the language in #15 clearly requires clients to actually validate this mapping).\r\nNote that leaving this option open is also necessary to not create a conflict with the OAuth WG's 7523-bis draft and the current text for an OIDC errata that require clients to use the issuer identifier (regardless of whether the AS Metadata/Discovery mechanism is used).\r\n\r\n>  (nowhere this is communicated through openid/oauth metadata??).\r\n\r\nTrue, it currently isn't and never was - this problem isn't new. Actually, this is another reason for expecting that many of the ASs that rely on clients getting all required metadata via AS Metadata/Discovery will already be pretty liberal in what they accept as `aud`.",
